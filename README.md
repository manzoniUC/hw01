Hello world! My name is Marc-Antoine Manzoni.
I'm a second (soon to be third year) in *The College*.
I am majoring in History, and minoring in East Asian Languages and Culture (EALC). Please enjoy this picture of myself and a very nice dog I met recently ![dog picture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vr-RLbybvd3sjpmVWwGDJr80dQSMO41B/view?usp=sharing)
# Academic Interests
I've recently been taking classes focused on Chinese history of the late Imperial and Republican periods. In my last class, I spent a lot of time working from [this](https://repository.duke.edu/dc/gamble) photo collection of photographs from the period - I highly encourage you to take a look at it if you have time.
# Hobbies
I play the double **bass** and electric **bass**. I also sing **bass** with the University of Chicago Glee Club - you can check out a video of us [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OD1kwWEbuY), if you'd like. There's a lot of **bass** going on in that video.
