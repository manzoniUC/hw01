Hello world! My name is Marc-Antoine Manzoni.
I'm a second (soon to be third year) in *The College*.
I am majoring in History, and minoring in East Asian Languages and Culture (EALC).
# Academic Interests
I've recently been taking classes focused on Chinese history of the late Imperial and Republican periods. In my last class, I spent a lot of time working from [this](https://repository.duke.edu/dc/gamble) photo collection of photographs from the period - I encourage you to take a look if you have time.
# Hobbies
I play the double bass and electric bass. I also sing with the University of Chicago Glee Club - you can check out a video of us [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OD1kwWEbuY), if you'd like.
